<h1>Los Angeles Lakers</h1>

  <p>  My name is Aziel Coronado and I really like sports. They help me unwind and change my focus from work every weekend.
Sports are huge in my family as well, everyone usually goes for the same team but sometimes family members switch teams.
    <p/>

    <p>One of my favorite sports is basketball because I've been watching it siince I was little. My favorite team growing up
was the Los Angeles Lakers! I watched them as my favorite player Kobe and his teammate Shaq won multiple championships.
I always watched the playoff's weating my Kobe jersey and remembering when he hit the game winning buzzer beater against
Phoenix.<p/>
